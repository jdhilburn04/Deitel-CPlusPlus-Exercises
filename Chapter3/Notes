Objectives:
- Conditional statements
- Iteration statements
- Counter controlled iteration
- Nested control statements
- Compound assignment/ increment/ decrement operators
- Why fundamental data types aren't portable

Conditional Statements
    If statement:
    - Performs an action if condition is true, or skips if condition is false
    - Single action

    If else statement:
    - Performs an action if condition is true, or performs another action if the condition is false
    - Double action

    Switches:
    - Performs many different actions depending on the value of the expression
    - Multi action

Iteration Statements in C++
    While
    For
    For (range based or for-each)
    do while
